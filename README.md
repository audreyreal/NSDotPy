# NSDotPy

A Python wrapper around requests for legally interacting with the HTML NationStates site, as well as a barebones API client. Built for legality first and foremost, as well as ease of use.

## Installation

`pip install nsdotpy`

## Simple Example

```python
from nsdotpy.session import NSClient
session = NSClient("NSDotPy Example," "1.0.0", "Script Author's nation", "Script User's nation")
if session.login("User Nation", "Password"):  # logs in and checks if login was successful
    session.move_to_region("Lily")  # only moves if you successfully logged in
```

## TODO:

- ~~Region Admin Controls~~
- Dossier and reports handling
- More fleshed out API Client
- Cards support
- Migrate automatic docs generation, code formatting, and PyPI uploading to GitHub Actions for better CI

## Docs

https://sw33ze.github.io/NSDotPy/nsdotpy/session.html#NSSession

## Generating Docs

1. [Ensure poetry is installed](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation), or your system's package manager if applicable.
2. Run `poetry install` in the root directory of the project to install dependencies if you haven't already.
3. Run `poetry run pdoc nsdotpy/session.py -d=google -o=docs/` to generate the docs

## Publishing to PyPi (for maintainers)

1. [Ensure poetry is installed](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation), or your system's package manager if applicable.
2. Run `poetry install` in the root directory of the project to install dependencies if you haven't already.
3. Run `poetry build` to build the package. Ensure the version number in `pyproject.toml` is correct against the version number in `session.py`.
4. Run `poetry publish` to publish the package to PyPi. You will need to have a PyPi account have supplied your API key to poetry.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. Ensure all code is formatted with `black`, that functions are type annotated (type annotating function variables not necessary), and docstrings are present using the Google style. If you use VSCode, [you can use this extension for easy docstring generation.](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=njpwerner.autodocstring)
